    "To do this, we will build a machine-learning-based predictive model that is trained on historical data, and used to predict the number of medals won by each country in the next Olympics. We'll build this model using high-level transformations of the data &mdash; called features &mdash; that are automatically generated from Featuretools. [Featuretools](https://featuretools.com) is a Python library for [automated feature engineering]().\n",

    "For one, the important features make a lot of sense. For 1964, the most important feature is `PERCENTILE(COUNT(medals_won WHERE Medal = Gold))`. This refers to the percentile across all countries of the count of gold medals won in all previous Olympics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The top feature in 1976 is more complicated but makes sense once we parse it. It's `MEAN(countries_at_olympic_games.PERCENTILE(NUM_UNIQUE(medals_won.MODE(medaling_athletes.Athlete))))`. This is a convoluted way of saying take the number of unique medaling athletes at each olympics a country competed in, find the percentile of that number in relation to the other countries, and take the average percentile over time. In other words, the average rank of the number of medaling athletes over time. The Mode part is an overcomplication that does not provide any additional information. So, if this value was high, it means that the country had on average a lot of medaling athletes in its historical Olympic showings.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2012, a few features down we have `TREND(countries_at_olympic_games.SKEW(medals_won.NUM_UNIQUE(medaling_athletes.Athlete)), Year)`. The way we have out data set up, each medal can be associated with many athletes (think: all the members of the medaling Soccer team). Therefore, this feature is looking at the skew (a statistical measure indicating whether more of the values lie toward the left or the right of the mean) of how many athletes there were per medal, and finding the the slope of a trend line fitted these skew numbers over time. One way to think of the skew number is whether the country won more medals in team sports than in individual sports, and the trend shows how that changes over time."
